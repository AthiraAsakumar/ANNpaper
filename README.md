# Detection of Diabetes Using Multilayer Perceptron

Detection of Diabetes Using Multilayer Perceptron
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that frequently results in severe complications. Diabetes is 
diagnosed and predicted using machine learning algorithms. The decision-making process for 
disease diagnosis and prognosis is significantly aided by learning-based algorithms. This paper 
investigates machine learning using neural networks and existing classification techniques for 
diabetes data. For the nearest K neighbours, Naive Bayes, complement shafts, decision shafts, 
radial base functions, and multilayer perceptron algorithms, we also assess various performance 
techniques with various characteristics. aids in the assessment of upcoming diabetic patients. The 
perceptron multilayer algorithm, which has an MSE value of 0.19 and the maximum prediction 
accuracy, is demonstrated in this work. MLP has the biggest area under the 86 percent curve and 
the fewest false positives and false negatives.
